# EcoAnalytics: Empowering EcoFlourish with Data-Driven Insights Using SQL
EcoFlourish is a leading provider of eco-friendly furniture, offering a wide range of sustainable products from office chairs to bedroom sets. Despite its commitment to sustainability and quality, EcoFlourish has been facing challenges in understanding customer preferences, sales trends, and inventory management. With twenty products across different categories and fifty customers signed up in 2022, EcoFlourish made a hundred sales in 2023, generating a total revenue of $72,239. However, the company lacks detailed insights into sales data, hindering strategic decision-making and marketing efforts.

To address these challenges, I was tasked with providing EcoFlourish with actionable insights through SQL queries. The goal was to enable EcoFlourish to make informed decisions on inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

After analyzing the data provided, I formulated several recommendations:

Inventory Management: Replenish stock for products with quantities less than fifty and consider increasing stock quantities for products priced above $500.

Product Pricing: Review pricing strategy for products priced between $200 and $300 and evaluate pricing for the top 10 most expensive products to ensure competitiveness and maximize revenue.

Marketing Strategies: Focus marketing efforts on top-selling categories, such as Office Furniture and Bedroom sets, and highlight the eco-friendly aspects of the products.

Customer Engagement: Implement a customer loyalty program and personalize marketing messages and offers based on customer data.

Sales Trend Analysis: Analyze sales data to identify seasonal trends and adjust inventory levels and marketing strategies accordingly.

By implementing these recommendations, EcoFlourish can expect improved inventory management, optimized pricing strategies, targeted marketing efforts, enhanced customer engagement, and a better understanding of sales trends. This will ultimately lead to increased sales, customer satisfaction, and sustainable business growth. Welcome to a greener, data-driven future with EcoAnalytics.
